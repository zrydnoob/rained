# Playing your level
To export your level to Rain World, select File > Render from the menubar (on the top). This is a process that takes a while. It will render a .txt file and one or more .png files into Levels folder. You can view this folder by clicking View > Show Render Folder... from the menubar. These rendered files use a different format than the format used for editing levels, so be sure to not have them mixed up with the type of level file you load in Rained.

You have to copy these files to a mod's "levels" folder to get them into Arena, or a subfolder within the "worlds" folder to get them into story mode. Once you are in them, you will use the Dev Tools to configure the level further, such as changing the color palette of the level, adding sounds, objects, etc. You will also have to edit a world_XX.txt file, or use a program like World Editor, to connect rooms together and add creature spawns.

This guide will not go over the details of doing that since Rained only concerns itself with level editing. But there are resources for that on the World Wide Web, such as [this wiki page about the Dev Tools](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/Dev_Tools) as well as [this page in regards to the world file format](https://rainworldmodding.miraheze.org/wiki/World_File_Format).

Happy lediting!
