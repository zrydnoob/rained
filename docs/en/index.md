Rained is a tool used to make Rain World levels.

The online version of this documentation is for the latest release version. If you have an older version, you should look at the local copy of the documentation which can be opened from the app.

Don't hestiate to report any bugs, complaints, and suggestions by creating an issue on GitHub, or pinging @chromosoze in either the main Rain World Discord server or one of both Rain World modding servers. I also accept DMs, but as I don't get pinged for DM requests, it will take a while for me to notice. If you send a crash report, please send me the contents of logs/latest.log.txt before relaunching the program.

Also, if you are on Windows and Rained fails to even open a window when launching it, you should read [the Dependencies section of this page](install-updates.md#dependencies).

Hope you enjoy!
