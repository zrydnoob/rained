Bugs:
- chain holder undo/redo is broken
- reported issue of lag building up over time... speeds up when opened a room with a lot of props
- reported increased usage while computer is locked
- reported crash in asset manager due to queues or something
- rained does not work if launched in a path with non-latin characters
  - need to test this again
- asset manager merging is actually kind of buggy
- don't clip mirror lines to scissor box
- errors when rendering new effects???
- using keyboards shortcuts while rendering does weird things
  fix: disable shortcuts while rendering

- using close all didn't register no file selected at one point?
  after testing render save prompt bug fix...

v2.2.0:
- version manager
- make mirror lines can go in middle of tiles
- radial menu for editor mode selection (bound to space - rebind rope simulation to Q/E/R)
- tile rect force geo thing solar asked
- rebindable edit mode switch keybinds
  - also, consider changing it to
     1: env
	 2: geo
	 3: tiles
	 4: props
	 5: effects
	 6: light
	 7: cameras
- optional download from solar's repo
- option to use "legacy" shortcut icons
- favorite tiles and props
- asset manager crap

Overall:
- logging
  - button to show latest log file
  - log window shows rained logs
- asset manager
  - can rearrange the order of stuff in asset manager
  - can change color in asset manager
  - fix merging
  - can select certain packs from solar repo?
- dissolve material/tile separation
- optimize tile deform rendering
- does update checker notif window timing work?
- prop selection box is affected by bfTiles (don't do this, also make optional from preferences. is this possible?)
- material previews. henry said i shouldn't try it because it will make the leditor very slow but I Don't Care.
  (i  mean i do care, i just think i can make it run reasonably fast by using spatial partitioning)
- autotiles
  - option to join only inner tiles
  - ability to recognize more than one tile as a direction type
  - cross beams autotile
    - ability to constrain autotile shape into a square
- method of generating approximated geometry from prop
- new level screen
- Move Level
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- level resize change history
- put asterik in window title for unsaved levels
- ability to have more than one level loaded at once

Geometry Editor:
- select and copy/paste
- show tool preview over mouse
- select and move geometry (make in conjunction with copy/paste)
- keyboard shortcut for shortcut & shortcut dots

Light Editor:
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix
- make brush density not dependent on refresh rate

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB
