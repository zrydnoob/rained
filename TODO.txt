  - fix merging
  - can select certain packs from solar repo?
- optimize tile deform rendering
- does update checker notif window timing work?
- prop selection box is affected by bfTiles (don't do this, also make optional from preferences. is this possible?)
- material previews. henry said i shouldn't try it because it will make the leditor very slow but I Don't Care.
  (i  mean i do care, i just think i can make it run reasonably fast by using spatial partitioning)
- new level screen
- Move Level
- undo/redo for level resize
- level resze drag
- level resize change history
- put asterik in window title for unsaved levels
- allow user to open levels with unrecognized tiles/props
  - so need to figure out how to store tiles/props by name only instead of
    by init reference... probably could use an ID system and most IDs are
    a reference to a tile but some IDs are for placeholders.

Geometry Editor:
- select and copy/paste
- show tool preview over mouse
- select and move geometry (make in conjunction with copy/paste)
- keyboard shortcut for shortcut & shortcut dots

Light Editor:
- toggle view shadow plane and occlusion plane
- prop/tile as brush

Effects Editor:
- WASD navigation
- only store the pixels that changed in the matrix
- make brush density not dependent on refresh rate

Prop Editor:
- do tile as prop depth change based on if specs2 is active?
- More tiles are located in startUp.lingo... also check out initDRInternal in comEditorUtils.lingo
- correct flipping of multiple props or freeform props
  freeform props should flip about the center of the AABB
