    This is the Lua script that Rained runs to initialize scripts/plugins.
    Load all of your desired Lua files here!

    Rained will also automatically load all scripts inside the "autoload" folder.

    I wrote type annotations and function documentation that should be recognized by
    Lua static analyzers such as sumneko-lua. Text for such are marked by a line that
    begins with three dashes.
