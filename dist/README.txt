This is a level editor used to make Rain World levels.

Don't hestiate to report any bugs, complaints, and suggestions by creating an issue on GitHub, or pinging @chromosoze in either
the main Rain World Discord server or one of both Rain World modding servers. I also accept DMs, but as I don't get pinged for
DM requests, it will take a while for me to notice. If you send a crash report, please send me the contents of logs/latest.log.txt
before relaunching the program.

Also, if you are on Windows and Rained fails to even open a window when launching it, it's probably because you are missing the
Microsoft Visual Studio C++ runtime package, which is needed for its dependencies. It can be installed
here:
    https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

More documentation can be found by going to one of these two sources:
- https://pkhead.github.io/rained/en/
- docs/index.html  (can also be opened inside the app)

Hope you enjoy!
